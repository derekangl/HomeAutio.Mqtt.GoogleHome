description: >
  Washers can have start and stop functionality independent from being on or off
  (some washers have separate power buttons, and some do not).
  Some can be paused and resumed while washing.

  Washers also have various modes and each mode has its own related settings.
  These are specific to the washer and are interpreted in a generalized form.
